# ⚙️ My n8n Workflow Portfolio

Welcome to my **n8n workflow portfolio** — a showcase of the automation projects I've built using [n8n](https://n8n.io/). These workflows highlight my ability to connect APIs, streamline tasks, and build smart, efficient systems.

## 🛠️ About This Repository

This repo serves as a **living portfolio** of real-world automations and integrations I've designed with n8n. Each workflow demonstrates my hands-on experience solving practical problems with:

- 🔄 Task automation
- 🌐 API and SaaS integrations
- 🧠 No-code / low-code logic
- 🗂️ Data manipulation and flow control

Whether you're evaluating my work for a role or looking for inspiration, you're in the right place.

## 🚀 Featured Workflows

Each folder contains:
- `.json` file of the workflow (exported from n8n)
- Optional `README.md` with explanation and setup steps
- Notes on environment variables, credentials, or context

> More workflows added regularly as I explore new tools and ideas.
